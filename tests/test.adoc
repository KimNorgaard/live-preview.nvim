== Introduction

AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup language that is similar to Markdown but provides more advanced features for technical documentation, books, and other types of structured documents. This document demonstrates various AsciiDoc elements and their use.

== Basic Formatting

Text in AsciiDoc can be formatted in various ways. Here are a few common examples:

- *Italic* text: Surround the word or phrase with underscores (`_`).
- **Bold** text: Surround the word or phrase with asterisks (`*`).
- `Monospace` text: Use backticks for inline code or file paths.

You can also create links, such as the link to https://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc's website].

== Lists

You can create both ordered and unordered lists in AsciiDoc.

=== Unordered List

* First item
* Second item
* Third item

=== Ordered List

. Step 1
. Step 2
. Step 3

=== Nested List

* Item A
** Sub-item A.1
** Sub-item A.2
* Item B

== Code Blocks

You can include code blocks for various programming languages. Here's an example of a Python code block:

[source, python]
----
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")

hello_world()
----

You can also use inline code, like this: `print("Hello, world!")`.

== Tables

Tables are an important part of many documents. Here's a simple table:

[cols="1,3,2", options="header"]
|===
| ID | Name         | Age
| 1  | Alice        | 30
| 2  | Bob          | 25
| 3  | Charlie      | 35
|===

== Blockquotes

Blockquotes are a great way to highlight important information or quotations. Here’s an example:

____
“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”
— Arthur C. Clarke
____

== Sections and Subsections

AsciiDoc supports structured documents with multiple levels of headings.

=== Subsection Example

This is a subsection under the current section. You can go as deep as needed with subsections, although three levels are typically sufficient for most documents.

==== Another Subsection

This is another level of subsection, showing how headings become smaller as you go deeper.

== Links and Images

You can include links and images in your document easily:

* Link to https://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoctor].
* Image: image::https://asciidoctor.org/images/octocat.png[GitHub Octocat, 200, 200]

== Callouts in Code

Callouts are useful in code snippets for explanations. Here's an example:

[source, javascript]
----
function sum(a, b) { // <1>
    return a + b;   // <2>
}
console.log(sum(1, 2)); // <3>
----
<1> Function definition
<2> Return the sum of the arguments
<3> Log the result to the console

== Footnotes

Footnotes are a way to provide additional information without disrupting the flow of the main text. Here’s an example:

This is an important fact.{footnote}:[The full explanation goes here.]

== Admonitions

AsciiDoc provides special blocks for warnings, tips, notes, and other types of admonitions:

[TIP]
====
Remember to save your work frequently!
====

[WARNING]
====
This action will permanently delete all data.
====

== Conclusion

AsciiDoc is a powerful tool for creating structured documents with a wide range of formatting options. Whether you're writing technical documentation, reports, or books, AsciiDoc offers the flexibility and clarity you need.
